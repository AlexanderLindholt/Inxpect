# ✨ Fast, easy, smart.
It's super efficient, and communicates with copies of itself<br>
from other plugins, ensuring only one plugin does the hard job.

<br>

Additionally, the syntax can't get any simpler!
```luau
local APIMap = require(script.APIMap) -- Inxpect is named 'APIMap' — since that makes sense.
```

<br>
Don't worry, it provides only what's important:

```luau
{
	Class (string) = {
		Property (string) = Type (string)
	}
}
```
